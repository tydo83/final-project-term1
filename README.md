# Code Immersive final project term 1

### What did you have?
It is a simple(?) app to help you track down what food you have a day. As a people saying I'm on a diet always, I write everything I ate a day on a note. Although I do this  
very seldom, this is indeed a good habit if you try to loose your weight or be healthy. This app is started from that idea.

### This app has two sections 
One is a simple memo app using html and js that you can add what you ate. Second one is a search bar to find nutritional info about the food you had using api.
